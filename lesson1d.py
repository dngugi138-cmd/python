# Create a python program that is able to calculate the simple interest given principle as 50000, rate as 5% and time as 8 years. SI = (p * R * t)/100
principle = 50000
rate = 5
time = 8
simpleinterest = (principle * rate * time) / 100
print("The simpleinterest is: ", simpleinterest)

# Assignment
# 1. Write a python program that is able to calculate the BMI of a person whose weight is 78kgs and height is 1.75 BMI = (weight) / (height squared)

weight = 78
height = 1.75
BMI = (weight) / (height ** 2)
print('The BMI is: ', BMI)

# 2. Find the Area and perimeter of a rectangle whose length is 48cm and width is 25cm

length = 48
width = 25
area = length * width
perimeter = (length + width) * 2
print('The area is: ', area)
print('This is the perimeter: ', perimeter)
